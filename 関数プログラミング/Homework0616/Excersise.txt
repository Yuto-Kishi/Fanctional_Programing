1. Type each piece of programs in the slides as one file, feed it
into CafeOBJ, and do some testing. Note that the extension of
a file name in which CafeOBJ programs are written is .cafe,
such as fact.cafe.
2. Explain in which way fact(5) is computed.

3. Explain in which way oedc-fact(5) is computed.

4. Write two versions of programs computing the summation
0+1+2+…+n for a given number n, where one corresponds to
fact and the other corresponds to oedc-fact and do some
testing for both versions.

5. Write a program in CafeoBJ that corresponds to the following
and do some testing
0
if n = 0
1
if n = 1
ext-fib(n) =
2
if n = 2
ext-fib(n–1) + ext-fib(n–2) + ext-fib(n–3)
otherwise
